# The Prototype

#### 1. All objects in JavaScript have a prototype

#### 2. Stated simply, the prototype is another object...

#### 3. ...that the original object **_inherits_** from, and has access to all of its prototypes's methods and properties

## Note:

1. Every `prototype` object inherits from `Object.prototype` by default.
2. An object's `Object.getPrototypeOf()` value can only be **_one_** unique `prototype` object.
